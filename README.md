# DISCIPLAN

> Plan is the best friend of discipline.

Not only as a calender, disciplan also help you assessing the progress in the past, and therefore creating a good plan for the future. With the cool design and the flexible usage, It will be like a familiar place that you visit every day. This is my f√≠rst project with the main goal of getting acquainted with new languages (Python, Javascript) new technologies (like React, FastAPI, Docker, Git). It also means, that there are a lot of bugs, unclean code and incomplete features, but I have leaned a lot of good stuffs from it. :heart: :yellow_heart: :green_heart: :purple_heart:
